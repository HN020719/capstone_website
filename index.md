## 🔍 Introduction  

Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder, with **APOE** identified as the strongest genetic risk factor. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have uncovered genetic loci associated with AD, but they do not directly explain the impact of variants on gene expression. Expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) analysis bridges this gap by linking genetic variants to transcriptional changes.

Recent advances in **deep learning** have enabled accurate prediction of gene expression from DNA sequences. Models like **Enformer** provide a powerful framework for understanding regulatory variants. Our study leverages deep learning to analyze how **SNPs within the APOE locus** influence gene expression and compares these predictions with eQTL findings to validate the model’s biological relevance.

## 🎯 Objectives  

- Investigate how **SNPs affect gene expression** in the **APOE locus**.  
- Utilize **deep learning (Enformer)** to predict transcriptional changes caused by SNPs.  
- Compare **eQTL analysis results** with **deep learning predictions** to validate findings.  
- Explore the potential integration of **Polygenic Risk Scores (PRS)** with deep learning for AD risk assessment.
